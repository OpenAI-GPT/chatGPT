# 9. Exercise - Meet A Member of our Community

Exercise: Meet The Community

Before diving in, let’s do our very first quick exercise and get things moving in a positive direction.

1. Introduce yourself in the Introduction channel #Introductions and practice getting used to working with Discord. [link](https://discord.gg/tKCws8S8)

You can share who you are and where you’re from, and why you’ve chosen to take this course. Working through the course on your own is totally fine, but having a community of support can be very helpful in learning new things as well sharing your excitement as your advance through the projects!

2. Go to the #Learning-Friends and reach out to find a community member who is also starting out to keep in touch with throughout your progress in the same course. By working through the course with somebody else you can help organized with the sections while getting familiar discussing projects and practicing stronger communication skills. This may seem a little corny, but it can prove quite valuable in keeping you on track to completing this course. And added bonus, maybe you’ll make some new friends along the way.

Some of the channels at your disposal are:

#chatGPT- For all questions chatGPT

#resources - A place where we can share articles and new technologies.

#alumni - To ask graduates of this course questions and for alumni members to connect with for future and current projects

#job-hunting - Anything related to finding a job in technology

#react Anything related to react.

....and many many more!

One thing I can promise you is that having a community to ask questions and grow with can majorly propel your positive learning experiences throughout this course. You can also follow me on social media where I will keep things updated including monthly remix challenges.
