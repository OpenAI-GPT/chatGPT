# 10. The Final Solution Code of the Project OpenAI ChatGPT Project

We have a very exciting journey ahead! That being said, it's always handy to have a copy of the solution code in case you get stuck or just as a point of reference when building a project step by step together :) 

Please find a copy of the final code attached as a resource to this article, but no cheating! It's way better to only use this at the end to compare orrr if you really get stuck. But even in that case, I would recommend you use the Q&A and Discord as a reference and guide to continue to practice and develop your interacting skills - which are very valuable - as a developer.
